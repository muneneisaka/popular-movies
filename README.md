To run the app, you will need a <b> TMDB API Key</b>. To get the key, you will need to create a developer account and request a key. 
Follow the instructions at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction.

Once you have the key, add it to a gradle.properties in the .gradle directory in your computer under the name "TMDBAPIKey"; 
Your gradle.properties file should now look like this TMDBAPIKey = "api key here"
